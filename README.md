# PATH-PLANNING-FOR-SELF-NAVIGATING-VEHICLE-FOR-SPECIALLY-ABLED-PEOPLE-DIVYANG-ELDERLY-E-VEHICLE

This project addresses the growing need for accessible transportation solutions for specially-abled and
elderly individuals. The focus is on developing a robust path-planning system using the improved A*
algorithm, a heuristic search algorithm known for its efficiency in finding optimal paths in complex
environments.
The project aims to design a system that ensures safe, efficient, and accessible navigation for
autonomous electric vehicles. By integrating map data and sensor inputs, the system uses a grid-based
representation to identify start and goal points, dynamically generating optimal and collision-free
paths. The improved A* algorithm is particularly suited for this application due to its ability to
compute the shortest feasible routes while avoiding obstacles.
The methodology involves simulating the improved A* algorithm in various scenarios, including
environments with static and dynamic obstacles. Performance metrics such as path length,
computation time, and adaptability are used to evaluate the system's effectiveness.Initial results
indicate that the improved A* algorithm provides a reliable and efficient solution for autonomous
navigation, meeting the projectâ€™s goals of ensuring safety and enhancing mobility. Future work
includes handling real-time challenges such as moving obstacles and integrating hardware systems for
real-world deployment. This project contributes to creating inclusive, autonomous transportation
solutions, empowering specially-abled and elderly individuals with greater independence and
mobility.
